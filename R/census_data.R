#' Key: list of 2011 Census tables that the "get_c11..." functions in this package can work with.
#'
#' This list shows all UK-based tables available from Nomis, as well as
#' most of the Key Statistics series for England and Wales.
#' The get_c11_uk and get_c11_ew functions should work for most of these
#' tables - no guarantees though.
