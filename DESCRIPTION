Title: Retrieve Population Data And Geographic Lookups For UK Geographic Areas
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Cassie Barton <bartonc@parliament.uk>
Maintainer: Cassie Barton <bartonc@parliament.uk>
Description: This package provides some basic functions to retrieve 2011 Census
   data and population estimates from Nomis, as well as a series of lookups
   for geographic areas. It's stuff that I find useful as a population
   statistician at the Commons Library.
